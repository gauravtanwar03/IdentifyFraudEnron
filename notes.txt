# Notes for working on the machine learning final project

## Feature selection
All available features are:

['poi', 'salary', 'to_messages', 'deferral_payments', 'total_payments', 'exercised_stock_options', 'bonus', 'restricted_stock', 'shared_receipt_with_poi', 'restricted_stock_deferred', 'total_stock_value', 'expenses', 'loan_advances', 'from_messages', 'other', 'from_this_person_to_poi', 'director_fees', 'deferred_income', 'long_term_incentive', 'from_poi_to_this_person']

They can be roughly grouped into financial features and email features

financial features: 
['salary', 'deferral_payments', 'total_payments', 'loan_advances', 'bonus', 'restricted_stock_deferred', 'deferred_income', 'total_stock_value', 'expenses', 'exercised_stock_options', 'other', 'long_term_incentive', 'restricted_stock', 'director_fees'] 
(all units are in US dollars)

email features: 
['to_messages', 'email_address', 'from_poi_to_this_person', 'from_messages', 'from_this_person_to_poi', 'poi', 'shared_receipt_with_poi'] 
(units are generally number of emails messages; notable exception is ‘email_address’, which is a text string)

Straight off the bat I can say that the email address features is going to be pretty useless so that can be discounted from the analysis. What is interesting however is that some people do not have an email address at all. This makes all the email features NaN. Presumably these emails were lost some how (suspicious...?). This could be a useful feature especially in a decision tree type of arrangement.

Another interesting point about this data set is that it is assumed when classifying a person as a POI or not that the POI labels for all other people are known. Otherwise how else could we know how many emails this person sent to POIs? In reality this would not be known and the problem could be posed as a structured classification problem using probabilistic graphical models. This would be cool to try.


# What is a POI?
Indicted (charged)
Settles without admitting guilt (fined)
Testified in exchange for immunity

# Imbalance in the data set
Number of people: 146
Number of POIs: 18
Fraction of examples that are POIs: 0.123287671233

!There are only 18 positive examples of POIs. This will make it very challenging to fit a model without overfitting. Boosting might be appropriate in this case.!

# Outlier detection
 - train with all data
 - finds points with highest residual error and remove
 - train again

# Feature scaling
 - remember to scale numeric features 

# Feature selection/ creation
 - Fraction of emails sent to/from pois may be of interest
 - Remember to use feature selection methods to eliminate useless features
